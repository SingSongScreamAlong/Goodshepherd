# The Good Shepherd

**Autonomous OSINT Intelligence Platform for Missionaries in Europe**

The Good Shepherd is a read-only, legally compliant intelligence platform that continuously ingests, enriches, and displays public information to give missionaries situational awareness of their operating environment.

## 🎯 Purpose

The platform provides missionaries with continuous awareness of:

- Neighborhood stability and public safety
- Protests & demonstrations
- Cultural and political shifts
- Legal changes affecting NGOs and churches
- Migration & community tensions
- Crime and public safety trends
- Infrastructure disruptions
- Health & environmental hazards
- Social sentiment trends

**Important:** This is a "pane of glass" for awareness, NOT a command & control system. The platform:
- ✅ Gathers and displays public intelligence (OSINT only)
- ✅ Provides visualizations, summaries, and insights
- ❌ Does NOT track private individuals
- ❌ Does NOT dispatch or direct real-world actions
- ❌ Does NOT perform intrusion or exploitation

## 🤖 LLM Enrichment

The platform uses AI to automatically enrich raw data:

**Entity Extraction:**
- Locations (cities, neighborhoods, countries)
- Organizations (agencies, NGOs, parties)
- Groups (protesters, residents, migrants)
- Topics (immigration, policy, religion)
- Keywords (key phrases)

**Automatic Categorization:**
12 categories: protest, crime, religious_freedom, cultural_tension, political, infrastructure, health, migration, economic, weather, community_event, other

**Sentiment Analysis:**
Positive, neutral, or negative classification

**Scoring:**
- **Confidence Score:** Based on text length, entity count, category specificity, source verification
- **Relevance Score:** Higher for safety-related events (crime, protest, health, religious freedom)
- **Priority Score:** Combines relevance, confidence, recency, and cluster size

**LLM Provider:**
- Primary: OpenAI (GPT-4 Turbo)
- Fallback: Basic keyword matching and rule-based analysis
- All methods include graceful degradation

## 🔗 Intelligence Fusion

The platform automatically detects and merges related events:

**Clustering Algorithm:**
- **Time Window:** Events within 24 hours can cluster
- **Location Matching:** Same city/neighborhood or within 50km
- **Category Match:** Same event category required
- **Text Similarity:** Jaccard similarity (0.6 threshold)

**Duplicate Detection:**
- Multiple sources reporting same incident
- Haversine distance for geospatial proximity
- Location name normalization and fuzzy matching
- Entity overlap analysis

**Event Fusion:**
- Merges multiple reports into unified view
- Combines source lists from all reports
- Merges entity lists (deduplicated)
- Uses best summary (highest confidence)
- Averages scores with multi-source boost
- Assesses stability trend over time

**Running Fusion:**
```bash
# Trigger fusion for events from last 24 hours
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ingest/fusion/run?hours_back=24 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```
